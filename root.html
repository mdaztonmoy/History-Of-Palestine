            <h1><i class="fa-solid fa-circle"></i>Root of Palestine</h1>

            <p>A brief introduction of Palestine <br>
                The name Palestine is the most commonly used from the Late Bronze Age (from 1300 BC) onwards. The name is evident in countless histories, "Abbasid inscriptions from the province of Jund Filastin (Elad 1992), Islamic numismatic evidence maps (including 'world maps' beginning with Classical Antiquity) and Philistine coins from the Iron Age and Antiquity, vast quantities of Umayyad and Abbasid Palestine coins bearing the mint name of Filastin. As we shall see below, the manuscripts of medieval al- Fustaat (old Cairo) Genizah also referred to the Arab Muslim province of Filastin (Gil 1996: 28-29), From the Late Bronze Age onwards, the names used for the region, such as Djahi, Retenu and Cana'an, all gave way to the name Palestine. Throughout Classical and Late Antiquity a term used by historians to describe a period between the 3rd and 8th centuries AD, a transitional period from Classical Antiquity to the Middle Ages in the Mediterranean world, Europe and the Near East the name Palestine remained the most common. Furthermore, in the course of the Roman, Byzantine and Islamic periods the conception and political geography of Palestine acquired official administrative status. This work sets out to explain and contextualize the multiple beginnings and evolution of the concept of Palestine, geographically, culturally, politically and administratively. It also seeks to demonstrate how the name 'Palestine' was most commonly and formally used in ancient history. It argues that the legend of the Israelites' conquest of Cana'an' and other master narratives of the Old Testament (or 'Hebrew Bible) a library of books built up across several centuries are myth-narratives designed to underpin false consciousness, not evidence-based history which promotes truth and understanding. It further argues that academic and school history curricula <br>
                </p>

                <p>should be based on contextualised historical facts, empirical evidence, archacological and scientific discoveries, not on conventional opinions or the fictional narratives of the Old Testament and religio-political dogmas repeatedly reproduced in the interest of powerful elites.</p>

                <p>The celebrated English historian and Enlightenment author Edward Gibbon, writing in 1776, noted that Phoenicia and Palestine will forever live in the [collective] memory of mankind'. Gibbon also astutely observed that the Romans, Persians and Arabs wanted Palestine for the extra-ordinary fertility of its soil, the opulence and beauty of its cities and purity of its air (Gibbon 1838, Vol. 1: 40; 1840, Vol. 5: 173).

                </p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>Today the idea of a country is often conflated with the modern concept of 'nation-state', but this was not always the case and countries existed long before nationalism or the creation of metanarratives for the nation-state. The conception of Palestine as a geo-political unit and a country (Arabic: bilad or qutr), with evolving boundaries, has developed historically and continues to do so. The identity and cultures of Palestine are living organisms: they change, evolve and develop. This work explores the representation of Palestine over time as a mixture of the perceived and conceived and the lived realities of the country. The evolving idea of Palestine is framed here within five basic assumptions which also centre on the principles of human agency, context and lived experiences:</p><br><br>
                <p> <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i>Palestine is the individual and collective bilad (country) in modern terms: watan, or mawtin ('homeland") of the Palestinian people: the indigenous people of historic Palestine (Filastin al-Tarikhiyyah) and the indigenized immigrants in Palestine. The Palestinian people (individually and collectively) have a multifaith and multicultural heritage and a multi- layered identity deeply rooted in the ancient past (Farsoun 1997). <br><br>
                    <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i>Palestinian history is a house of many mansions to echo an expression coined by the late Lebanese historian Kamal Salibi in connection with the modern history of Lebanon. The cultural pluralism of Palestine and the multi-tier identity of the Palestinians (as individual and collective agencies) must be situated within their evolving social, cultural and political context and actual historical circumstances. <br><br>

                    <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i>The multicultural dimensions of Palestianness and the      textured polity of Palestine are grounded here in the living history and living experiences of the indigenous people of Palestine and the Palestinised immigrants in the country <br><br>
                    
                    <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i>Of particular interest here are the urbanisation processes, the emergence of early city city-states and state formation in Palestine. Contrary to the claims about the tribal organs of the state in the Arab Middle East, this book argues that early state formation in Palestine and the wider Near East was a product of urbanisation processes. These processes began in the Early Bronze Age at around 3200 BC and were associated with the emergence of great urban centres in Palestine stratified urban social spaces in comparison with the somewhat smaller and more egalitarian Chalcolithic localities in the country (4000-3200 BC). In the course of the Early Bronze Age urbanisation in the great urban centers in the country, each about 100-400 dunums in size, was accompanied with the appearance of the Semitic alphabet, stratified society, public buildings, palaces, temples, towers and fortification systems. Some of urban centers which emerged in Early Bronze Age Palestine were represented in Jericho, Gaza, Tell al-Ajjul, Tell al-Satan, Tell al-Tell, Jerusalem, Tell Dothan, Tell Taannek and Tell al-Mutasallim the latter being the archaeological site of the powerful city-state of Megiddo which emerged during the Bronze Age (Taha 2017: 6-11; De Vaux 1966). The work will also explore the interaction of Palestinian cities across history with their surrounding rural life and the wider regional context. In this respect, Henri Lefebvre's three constituents of the social production of urban spaces perceived, conceived and lived experiences (Lefebvre 2011) - are relevant to the way multicultural urban Palestine Caesarea- Palaestina (also known as Caesarea Maritima; Arabic: Qaysariah), Gaza (Ghazzah) Ascalon ('Asqalan), Nablus, al-Ramla, Jerusalem, Acre (Arabic Akka; Greek: Ptolemais) Nazareth, Jaffa, Tiberias, Beisan, Safad evolved historically. Greek, Roman and Byzantine urbanization processes and urban planning were maintained under Islam in the Middle Ages and this urban planning is still visible today in the Arab Islamic medieval Old City of Jerusalem, a city whose urban planning and architecture are among the best surviving medieval cities in the world.

                <h1><i class="fa-solid fa-circle"></i>Collective religious memory versus evidence-based history: polytheistic Palestine, pluralism and the archaeological evidence  </h1>
                      <p>In Palestine multifaith and polytheism went hand in hand and for millennia the country was a multifaith/polytheistic polity; the multitude of religions and cultures in Palestine is one of its most striking and characteristic features. This multitude of faiths in the country and the role of Palestine (and Arabia) as the birthplace of the three monotheistic traditions is a major topic of this work, which argues that religious pluralism has always been at the heart of the pluralist identity of Palestine, well before monotheism, Writing in the 5th century BC, Herodotus was the first historian to describe vividly a multifaith country located naturally (geographically) between Phoenicia and Egypt, and to denote a geographical region he called Palaistine (Παλαιστίνη) which was larger than ancient Philistia. He also reported that Palestine was deeply polytheistic. Today the findings of archaeology, including recent archaeological excavations in Philistia, which are central to the ways in which the ancient history and heritage of Palestine are understood and taught in Western universities and schools, confirm Herodotus account of polytheistic Palestine and contradict the grand narratives of the Old Testament. In fact monotheism evolved gradually (not in a revolutionary fashion) through a centering strategy of representation from polytheism (many pagan gods) to monolatrism, and from 'mono-polytheism (pagan 'God of gods') to strict monotheism, focusing on one God and one authority, under Islam in the early Middle Ages.

                      </p>
                      <p>The terms holy 'Bible' and 'biblical" as signifiers meant different things to different people across the centuries. Today it is widely recognized that the 'Bible' is not a single book, it is a library of books. While Christianity distinguishes between two traditions, Old Testament and New Testament, the Quran identifies three distinct traditions, or holy books, associated with the Bible: The Tawrah (or Torah) attributed to Moses, the Injil, the Arabic name for what Muslims believe to have been the original Gospel of Jesus, and Zabur (or the Book of Psalms), attributed to David. The diversity of traditions and sources associated with the evolution of the Bible" is central to any scholarly understanding of the evolution of 'biblical' narratives.</p>
                      <p>Furthermore, the "biblical narratives are literary imagination, adaption, theology and officially sanctioned memory. not history. Its stories and narratives were derived from conventional wisdom, which was produced. and circulated by educated elites and opinion formers of the time, which may not contain facts. Much of the research on the Old Testament focuses on its Babylonian conventional wisdom and recreated Babylonian social memory (Masalha 2007), but also evidently recreated Greek religious memory, and Hellenistic imagination and representations are adapted in the stories of the Old Testament (Hjelm and Thompson 2016). The adaptation and reimagining of Hellenistic representations are also evident in the 'mono-polytheism of the Old Testament. The impact of "Hellenization on the literary imagination and representations of the Old Testament and the representation of the divine in the post-Alexander cra should not be underestimated. Hellenistic allegorized representations had constructed a hierarchical pantheon of 'King of gods a supreme absolute deity (Zeus) at the head of twelve Olympian deities'. This pagan Greek mono-polytheism was represented by Zeus as God of gods' ('Representation of representations"). The Greek term there was later conflated with doe’s ('to the gods'), although etymologically the word is not related to Latin deus, which comes from a different root. However, in spite of these etymological differences, in Latin deus and theos became inescapably linked. And so on...

            <h1>Chapter 1 | Historical Context - The Roots of the Palestinian Struggle</h1>

            <p>The historical context of the Palestinian struggle is deeply rooted in the complex narrative of early Zionist movements, colonial influence, and international politics that predate the 20th century. Understanding this historical backdrop is essential to grasp the modern Palestinian issue. The early Zionist movements, which began in earnest in Europe during the late 19th century, aimed to establish a homeland for Jews in response to centuries of persecution and the rising tide of nationalism sweeping through the continent. These movements saw Palestine, a region of deep religious significance and a tapestry of diverse communities, as the ideal place for a Jewish state. Figures such as Theodor Herzl, a primary pioneer of political Zionism, advocated for Jewish immigration to Palestine and the establishment of a sovereign Jewish state. However, this vision carried substantial implications for the existing Arab population in the region, who constituted the majority at the time. The entry of British colonial policies into the geopolitical equation profoundly impacted Palestinian lands. During World War I, Britain's strategic interests in the Middle East led to the controversial Balfour Declaration of 1917. This declaration expressed British support for "the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people." The document's vague language on protecting the "civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine" left room for significant contention. The British mandate over Palestine, formalized after World War I by the League of Nations, further exacerbated tensions between Jewish and Arab communities. British colonial administration attempted to balance Jewish immigration and land purchases with maintaining order among the Arab population, leading to frequent clashes and an increasingly volatile situation. The policies and administrative practices implemented by the British often favored Zionist objectives, fostering resentment and escalating communal conflicts. As Jewish immigration increased, propelled by rising anti-Semitism in Europe and the horrors of the Holocaust, the demographic landscape of Palestine began to shift. Land purchases by Jewish organizations often resulted in the displacement of Arab tenants, fuelling further animosity. The economic and cultural fabric of Palestinian society witnessed growing strains under the weight of these demographic changes. The implications of British colonial practices and early Zionist activities culminated in a fragmented Palestinian society, caught in the throes of a transformative period marked by international maneuvering and colonial interests. The Balfour Declaration, in particular, sowed seeds of discord that would later play out in the tragic and violent disputes over land, identity, and governance. Thus, the roots of the Palestinian struggle are intricately tied to the convergence of early Zionist aspirations and British colonial strategies. This historical period set the stage for a prolonged and deeply complex conflict, leaving an indelible mark on the collective memory and identity of Palestinian society. Understanding these foundational events is crucial to comprehending the ongoing struggles and the enduring quest for justice, recognition, and peace in the region.</p>

            <h1>Chapter 2 | The Nakba - Catastrophe and Displacement in 1948</h1>

           <p>The Nakba, or "catastrophe" in Arabic, is a pivotal event in the Palestinian narrative, marked by the traumatic upheaval ensuing the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. Detailed accounts reveal that the roots of this catastrophic event lie in the broader geopolitical shifts and confrontations that characterized the early to mid-20th century. The United Nations' Resolution 181, passed in 1947, proposed the partition of Palestine into separate Jewish and Arab states, a plan which was accepted by the Jewish community but vehemently rejected by the Arab population. This resolution set the stage for escalating tensions, which erupted into full-blown conflict as the British mandate in Palestine ended and the state of Israel declared independence on May 14, 1948. The immediate aftermath saw an onslaught of military operations across Palestinian territories, leading to widespread violence and hostilities. The nascent Israeli forces clashed with Arab armies, exacerbating an already volatile situation. For Palestinians, this period was marked by unprecedented mass displacement and dispossession, culminating in what they regard as al-Nakba. Approximately 750,000 Palestinians were uprooted from their homes, villages were razed, and entire communities were subjected to forced migrations. Cities like Haifa, Jaffa, and Lydda, which previously boasted significant Palestinian populations, witnessed large-scale expulsions. The socio-economic and cultural fabric of Palestinian society suffered irreparable damage. The loss of agricultural lands, homes, and infrastructure not only destabilized daily life but also stripped the Palestinian people of their historical and ancestral connections to the land. Refugee camps were hastily established in neighboring countries such as Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, and the Gaza Strip, where displaced Palestinians sought shelter, often under harsh and substandard conditions that persist to this day. The creation of the state of Israel fundamentally altered the geopolitical landscape of the region, but its consequences were particularly stark for Palestinians. The international community, though cognizant of the refugee crisis, was largely ineffective in addressing their plight. Humanitarian concerns were eclipsed by geopolitical interests and burgeoning Cold War dynamics. The resulting stagnation in addressing the refugee issue compounded the trauma, embedding the Nakba deeply into the collective memory and identity of Palestinians. The newly declared state of Israel embarked on a nation-building project that involved solidifying control over all the territories awarded under the UN partition plan and more. This expansionist approach further displaced Palestinian communities and redrew territorial boundaries, often unilaterally. These actions set precedents that would complicate future peace negotiations and reinforced the sense of urgency in resolving the Palestinian question. The impact on Palestinian territorial integrity was profound. The loss of land was not just a physical displacement but also an existential crisis. Over time, Palestinian political structures attempted to address the realities of dispersion and loss of homeland, coalescing into various movements advocating for return, recognition, and restitution. The Nakba, therefore, remains a defining event that continues to shape Palestinian identity, grievances, and the continued struggle for self-determination. In summary, the Nakba represents not just a historical event but an ongoing reality for Palestinians. It set into motion a sequence of dispossessions and dispersions that fractured Palestinian society and seared the collective memory. The persistent state of refugeehood and the complex socio-political ramifications underscore the catastrophic nature of 1948 for Palestinians, forming a stark contrast to the celebratory narratives surrounding the establishment of the state of Israel. The enduring consequences of the Nakba continue to influence the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and remain central to understanding the regional dynamics and the quest for justice and peace.</p>

            <h1>Chapter 3 | The Role of International Powers and Diplomacy</h1>

          <p>The involvement of international powers has been a defining feature of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, bringing layers of complexity and external influence that have shaped its trajectory. From its earliest stages, international diplomacy and political agendas have played a crucial role in either advancing or stalling the efforts for peace and justice in the region. In the aftermath of World War II, global geopolitics were heavily influenced by the onset of the Cold War, which saw the United States and the Soviet Union emerging as the two dominant superpowers, each vying for influence in strategically important regions, including the Middle East. The Palestinian-Israeli conflict became entangled in this broader struggle, as both superpowers sought to align new and existing states with their respective ideologies and economic interests. The United Nations (UN) was one of the earliest international bodies to engage with the Palestinian question, convening to address the partition plan that sought to create separate Jewish and Arab states within Palestine. Despite the Palestinian Arab community's strong opposition and the plan's subsequent implementation in 1948, the UN's involvement laid the foundation for its ongoing role in attempting to mediate the conflict. Over the years, the UN has passed numerous resolutions addressing the conflict, though enforcement and impact have been inconsistent, often hampered by the geopolitical interests of its member states. The United States has played an especially pivotal role in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. As a staunch ally of Israel, US foreign policy has frequently provided diplomatic, military, and financial support to the Israeli state. This unwavering support has often been a point of contention in international diplomacy, with critics arguing that it has emboldened Israeli policies that are detrimental to Palestinian rights and statehood aspirations. Successive US administrations have attempted to broker peace agreements, most notably the Camp David Accords in 1978 and the Oslo Accords in the 1990s. While these efforts have led to temporary engagements and partial agreements, a comprehensive and lasting solution has remained elusive. Europe, too, has had its influence, with several European nations historically bearing responsibilities due to their colonial pasts and subsequent political interests. The British mandate in Palestine set the stage for many of the territorial and demographic conflicts that followed, while post-war European countries have varied in their levels of engagement, sometimes siding with the US-led peace initiatives or pursuing independent diplomatic channels. Throughout this period, the shifting allegiances and interventions of Middle Eastern countries have also significantly impacted the dynamics of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. Countries like Egypt, Jordan, and Syria have had direct military and political involvements, often motivated by regional power balances.</p>

            <h1>Chapter 4 | The Palestinian Liberation Movement - Rise and Evolution</h1>

           <p>The Palestinian Liberation Movement – Rise and Evolution The Palestinian national movement emerged as a forceful response to the dispossession and displacement experienced by Palestinians, particularly post-1948. Central to this evolution was the establishment of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) in 1964. The PLO was conceived as an umbrella organization intended to unify various Palestinian factions and articulate a cohesive national identity and political agenda. Key figures in the early stages of the movement included prominent leaders like Yasser Arafat, who would eventually become the face of the Palestinian struggle on the international stage. The early years of the PLO were marked by the adoption of guerrilla tactics and armed resistance against Israeli targets. This period saw the rise of groups such as Fatah, under Arafat’s leadership, which sought to reclaim Palestinian land and assert Palestinian national rights through military means. These actions were viewed as a response to the Israeli occupation and aimed at drawing global attention to the Palestinian cause. The PLO's strategies reflected a broader regional militancy that characterized much of the Middle Eastern geopolitics during the 1960s and 1970s. However, the PLO's activities were not confined to military operations alone. International diplomacy became an equally crucial arena for advancing Palestinian aspirations. The organization sought to gain recognition and support from various countries and international bodies. The 1974 Arab League summit in Rabat was a pivotal moment when the PLO was recognized as the “sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people,” bolstering its diplomatic clout. This recognition facilitated the PLO's observer status at the United Nations the same year, further legitimizing its role on the global stage. The quest for Palestinian self-determination became a keystone in the PLO’s political stance. Over time, there was a significant ideological shift within the organization, moving from an initial emphasis on armed struggle towards a more nuanced approach that incorporated both political and diplomatic efforts. This evolution was partly influenced by the changing dynamics of international politics and the realization of the limitations of guerrilla warfare in achieving long-term political objectives. The PLO’s transition towards diplomacy culminated in the historic Oslo Accords of the early 1990s. These agreements marked a tangible, though contentious, step towards resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. While the accords established frameworks for Palestinian self-governance in parts of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, they also highlighted deep-seated divisions within Palestinian society regarding the efficacy and consequences of negotiating with Israel. The impact of these developments was multifaceted. Guerrilla warfare imbued the Palestinian struggle with a sense of urgency and resistance that captivated global audien</p>
