        <p>If I must die,<br>
            you must live <br>
            to tell my story <br>
            to sell my things <br> 
            to buy a piece of cloth <br>
            and some strings, <br>
            (make it white with a long tail) <br>
            so that a child, somewhere in Gaza <br>
            while looking heaven in the eye <br>
            awaiting his dad who left in a blaze- <br>
            and bid no one farewell <br>
            not even to his flesh not even to himself- <br>
            sees the kite, my kite you made, flying up above <br>
            and thinks for a moment an angel is there <br>
            bringing back love <br>
            If I must die let it bring hope <br>
            let it be a tale.

        <p>Suddenly I <br>
            "in ablaze" died. <br>
            Suddenly time <br>

            Suddenly you can't find my body, <br>
            can't bury <br>
            what you can't find. <br>
            My final poem, <br>
            I wrote years before <br>
            my hour arrived. <br>
            Suddenly my voice, <br>
            thought voiceless <br>
            because stateless, <br>
            gave voice <br>
            to a noisy world. <br>
            Suddenly "a kite." <br>

        <br>
        <p>The maps are not what they once were, <br>
            The surgeon said hovering my naked body. <br>
            <br>
            The metal table he'd spread us on was a bed <br>
            of thorns no rose could grow, the only limb <br>
            my scribe could hold was my wilting palm, <br>
            like a dying dove god tossed in water, just <br>
            to hear me ebb away to the ocean wave of: <br>
            <br>
            mamma I'm fine <br>
            mamma I'm fine <br>
            I'm falling asleep <br>
            in little Palestine <br>
            <br>
            The discourse of my placenta, the subject of <br>
            contradiction: no one really knew if a womb <br>
            could survive being annexed 26 times. They said, <br>
            her blue cord never learned to choke the sea <br>
            before it could learn to love her screams. <br>
            <br>
            I told the scribe mamma I'm fine mamma I'm fine <br>
            and all she could do was wind down the memory <br>
            of my miniature spine with a shattered glass of wine, <br>
            for the scribe's blue eyes were not allowed to cry <br>
            when she spread butterfly thighs on a metal moon sky, <br>
            punctured my insides like Akkadian fire-flies: <br>
            <br>
            watched him open me up with a keyhole <br>
            knife just to make sure little Assyria civilized, <br>
            <br>
            just to hear Wadea Al-Fayoume say, <br>
            <br>
            mamma I'm fine <br>
            mamma I'm fine <br>
            <br>
            Stabbed 26 times <br>
            cause he'd jump <br>
            up and down in <br>
            little Palestine. <br>

        <p>With clean hands. <br>
            he gently sifts the flour. <br>
            and adds a handful of yeast. <br>
            He pours the warm water <br>
            for the yeast particles to live, <br>
            then rolls and kneads and rolls <br>
            and kneads the dough. <br>
            <br>
            He lets the soft mass rest. <br>
            <br>
            With firm but gentle hands. <br>
            he rounds it into balls, <br>
            flattens them into shape, <br>
            and handles each one <br>
            delicately into the oven. <br>
            <br>
            Soon, perhaps in half an hour, <br>
            the bread rolls are born fresh, <br>
            healthy and browned. <br>
            <br>
            The newborn breads breathe, <br>
            yet dust chokes the air, <br>
            searing gasses penetrate <br>
            their thin, fragile crusts. <br>
            <br>
            On the day of their birth, a missile, <br>
            a bakery, a scattering <br>
            of zaatar, flesh, and blood.

        <p>Yesterday, a star said <br>
            to the little light in my heart, <br>
            We are not just transients <br>
            passing. <br>
            <br>
            Do not die. Beneath this glow <br>
            some wanderers go on <br>
            walking. <br>
            <br>
            You were first created out of love, <br>
            so, carry nothing but love <br>
            to those who are trembling. <br>
            <br>
            One day, all gardens sprouted <br>
            from our names, from what remained <br>
            of hearts yearning. <br>
            <br>
            And since it came of age, this ancient language <br>
            has taught us how to heal others <br>
            with our longing, <br>
            <br>
        </p>
            <p>
            how to be a heavenly scent <br>
            to relax their tightening lungs: a welcome sigh, <br>
            a gasp of oxygen. <br>
            <br>
            Softly, we pass over wounds, <br>
            like purposeful gauze, a hint of relief, <br>
            an aspirin. <br>
            <br>
            O little light in me, don't die, <br>
            even if all the galaxies of the world <br>
            close in. <br>
            <br>
            O little light in me, say: <br>
            Enter my heart in peace. <br>
            All of you, come in!
