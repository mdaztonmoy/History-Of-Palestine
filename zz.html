            <h1>The Existence of an International Jewish Conspiracy</h1>

            <p>
                It is believed that the Jews have been subjected to many persecutions throughout history due to three reasons - religious prejudice, economic revenge and social hatred. However, whether they admit it or not, the Gentiles have never been obsessed with religious prejudice and have never turned against them. However, economic revenge can be said to be one of the reasons. Because, even if they do not want wealth, they often create enemies. Moreover, how such a small nation became the owner of so much wealth has also been a cause of concern for many. Although they defend themselves in this regard and say that the Creator has crowned them with economic superiority. Basically, these are nothing more than stories they have made up. <br> <br>
                The Jews have divided society into three classes using wealth as a criterion - the upper class, the middle class and the lower class. <br>
                They have made this division in such a subtle way that everyone assumes that only those who have a lot of wealth are from the upper class of society. Whatever they say becomes the law of the society. There is no longer any debate about how logical the matter is. It seems that no one cares about the source of this wealth. <br> <br>
                According to the Bible, when Moses went to Mount Sinai to talk to the Creator, in his absence the Israelites made a golden calf and started worshipping it, which is known as the Golden Calf. They wanted to convey that money is God. All worship is only for its sake. Only those who give importance to this wealth will be the upper class of society.  <br> <br>
                For this reason, it can be seen that when the Jews entered a new country, no one cared. Because, their condition was like that of beggars. But after a while, when they became so rich in money and wealth, even kings and emperors would pay homage to them. <br>
                The Jews would create new laws for their own convenience and impose them on the general public. If they wanted, the financial market would collapse. Again, the market would boom and millions of people would make a living. The keys to all the major stock markets in the world, including Wall Street, are now in their hands! <br> <br>

                Talking about social hatred, in all ages, some objectionable incidents between Jews and Gentiles were seen, but it was not unusual. There are many examples where a Christian and an atheist grew up together; they were neighbors. They often argued about religious beliefs, but it never turned into bloodshed. <br> <br>
                Apart from these three issues, there are some other reasons that have angered the general public against them. This has been discussed enough in the previous chapters. For example: the policy of separate nationalism, lack of patriotism, breaking social norms, smuggling information, etc. Now let's discuss how the Jews are playing chess in the conspiratorial world politics. <br> <br>

                A very influential Jew of the 19th century is Theodor Herzl. He is also called one of the architects of the present Israel. One of his famous quotes is - 'We are a people - One people.' He clearly said that there is no alternative to the policy of separate nationalism to maintain our existence. At the first Zionist conference in 1897, he said - 'When we fall into any danger, we rise as a revolutionary proletariat with an indomitable force. Then it is no longer possible to defeat us. We become the source of an incomparable - indomitable force.' <br> <br> In the introduction to the book The Jewish State, he mentioned - <br> 'I also believe that anti-Semitism is a really big movement. Through this ugly movement, commercial revenge and religious intolerance are being incited. It has become a national problem, the solution of which requires the unification of all political figures in civilized countries.' <br> <br> In 1902, in response to a question from Major Evans Gordon at a discussion organized by the British Royal Commission, Dr. Herzl said: 'I will introduce you to a state that does not exist today. But it is soon to take its place on the world map. Due to historical reasons, the descendants of this state have had to face numerous enemies. If you want, you can add the adjective 'Jew' before the state. Then you can understand what the full form of this state can be.' <br> Lord Eustace Percy is a famous British writer and politician. At that time, he published an article about this particular ethnic group, which was later supported by the Canadian Jewish Chronicle. Some important parts of the article are highlighted below- <br> <br>

                  <br>
                  'By establishing these two principles of Liberalism and Nationalism, the European inhabitants were able to establish equal rights in their own countries. Along with this, the rights of minorities were also established in this journey, which ensured everyone's access to administrative positions. Using this as a strategy, the Jews living in different parts of Europe came out with great glory. They started to struggle about how to make the administrative positions of the state their own. When power came into their hands, they opposed the two policies again. At one time, two parties were born for and against the two policies, which again divided the unifying Europe. 

                   <br> <br>
                   The Jews were usually seen doing two things to interfere in any independent state. To destroy the entire constitutional structure of that state and to establish their own chosen social system there.
                    <br> <br>
                    Today the sky of Europe is covered with the clouds of Zionism and Bolshevism. Zionism is the symbol of the political and national unity of the Jews, which is working towards the establishment of imperialism around the world. Just as the Jews captured Constantinople and gave birth to the Turkish revolution in the twentieth century, using the two republican and socialist ideologies, they have given birth to the Bolshevik revolution to capture Europe today.

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    To establish their dominance, the Jews have repeatedly attacked Gentile states and changed the regime. For example: They have replaced monarchy with republic, replaced republic with socialism, and in many places replaced republic with democracy. They will one day establish their power by destroying the entire world's governance system.
                    <br> <br>
                    They were once isolated due to various immoral and terrorist activities. So, they created a ghetto-based social system for themselves. Their activities were specified so that the society would not be corrupted by coming into contact with the Jews. That is, they could not participate in administrative or business activities if they wanted to. To get out of this situation, the Jews used the democratic movement as a tool, which established them in society. The peace talks after the First World War are one such example.
                    <br> <br>
                    They have given birth to numerous wars and conflicts around the world. Each war opens the door to new peace talks, the high posts of which are always reserved for the Jews. And from there, new laws and regulations are created by turning the stick in their hands. To know about this, anyone can research the Sixth Zionist Conference-1903.
                    <br> <br>
                    As promised in the First World War, the British government handed over the keys to Palestine to the Jews after the Ottomans were driven out. Even then, they still have a long way to go to establish the much-awaited Israel. Many members of the Jewish community have not yet returned to Palestine. They are scattered in various countries due to security and housing problems.

                    <br> <br>
                    On June 25, 1920, Herman Bernstein, spokesman for the American Hebrew magazine, published an article in his journal:'A few days ago a representative of the American Justice Department came to me with a manuscript entitled 'The Jewish Peril.' The manuscript is a translation of a Russian book published in 1905, which has long since been withdrawn from the market. The manuscript contains many instructions on how the Jews will bring the entire Gentile population of the world under their control.'

                    <br> <br>
                    **. In our cities, large slums are often seen, where large numbers of people live together in close quarters. Until the French Revolution, Jews lived in such a social system. However, the word ghetto does not literally mean slum. The Jews created such a social system for their own needs, so that they could maintain the strength of relations among themselves. Jews of all classes, rich and poor, lived here together.
                    <br> <br>In 1896, Dr. Herzl prepared a preliminary draft of these instructions, which was presented for the first time at the Zionist conference held in Basel, Switzerland in 1897. Later, from 1903 to 1905, this complete draft began to appear in the market in numerous small volumes, which was eventually published in the form of a complete book. As there was a huge uproar about this in the Russian market, the book was removed from there, but by that time numerous copies of it had reached the hands of the common people. Due to this, it was not possible to completely disappear. A copy of this complete draft is still stored in the British Museum, on which is written - 'August 10, 1906'.

                    <br> <br>  
                    The manuscript about which there is so much fuss, is called - Protocols of the Learned Elder Zion. Based on this, in 1920, the London magazine Kzre and Spottiswoode published an article, about which the Jews living in London also started a fuss. They used the London Times magazine as an alternative to cover their disgrace. They called the article published by Kzre and Spottiswoode 'sad' and called such work a part of madness
                    <br> <br>
                    But this was the blueprint on the basis of which the Jews have given rise to countless wars around the world. They have created differences between people. They have filled all sides with subculture. They have given rise to atheism in the education system. They have hijacked the economy and have only achieved their own interests in the post-World War peace talks. Jewish organizations have not admitted any involvement in this document to this day; rather, they have been claiming that it is part of the deliberate propaganda of some conspiring group against them. 
                    <br> <br>
                    Whether or not there is any confession from the Jews, the way this entire document has so far coincided with the implementation of their ultimate goal cannot be a mere coincidence. This will be discussed throughout the next several chapters.
                    <br> <br>
                    History of the Establishment of Imperialism
                     <br> <br>
                     On June 19, 1920, the Chicago Tribune published an article titled "Trotsky Leads Jew-Radicals to World Rule. Bolshevism Only a Tool for His Scheme." The Bolshevik Revolution was part of a long-term plan by Jewish spies,
                     <br> <br>
                     It is explained in detail in this article. Apart from that, very soon many more destructive movements are going to take place in different parts of the world - the strict warning is also presented in that writing. In the past, many newspaper organizations have been subjected to insults while publishing such news. As it happened, they removed the column shortly after the news was published and apologized for the misinformation statement. Some important words of the article published on 19th are highlighted-"In the last two years, valuable military intelligence information has come into our hands, indicating that many more Bolshevik-like revolutions are soon to strike the earth." The identity of those who are constantly working behind it has become clear to us, though late. British and French intelligence organizations have already discovered their conspiracy. 
                     <br> <br>
                     Communism is one of the major tools to implement their blueprint. At the beginning of the 20th century, the movement that they gave rise to in the eastern countries did not aim to establish communism in the society. Gradually, their attack will reach the Western and Middle Eastern countries as well. They will not allow a state like theirs to survive. If necessary, they will not hesitate to impose Islamic revolution on England, Japanese revolution on India and trade conflict between America and China. The main purpose of all the movements they instigate is to overthrow all the existing regimes of the world and to establish their own regime in its place; Not to establish peace. 'On June 21, 1920, the Chicago Tribune published another article entitled World Mischief, in which various illustrations of their mischief were presented. At first, they try to prove these facts as lies, rumors and fabricated stories. But when people start presenting the evidence, they again change their voice and say-'What is so surprising if a small nation that has long endured the world's many tortures dreams of ruling the world by ousting its enemies?'
                     <br> <br>
According to the Jewish Encyclopedia, they had no king until the beginning of the Christian era. In the sixth century BC, the Babylonian general Nebuchad Nezer attacked Jerusalem, killing many of its inhabitants and taking 60-70 thousand Israelites captive. However, many of them were later released. In 70 AD, the Romans, led by the general Titus, invaded the Holy Land again and exiled everyone. From then until the Balfour Declaration, they never collectively returned to Jerusalem. They were a nomadic people. There is a special significance in repeating these words. After being exiled for the first time by the Babylonian invasion, they created an invisible regime to remain united even in exile. But this system was not fully formed then. Because, after some time they returned to Jerusalem again. But the second time they were exiled by the Romans, the Jews added a king to the system of governance. No matter how far the Jews were scattered throughout the world, it was obligatory for them to obey the king's orders. He was their guardian. All the kings they have elected so far are called 'Exilarch'. This invisible state was also called Israel. They were committed to maintaining this regime as long as the Jews were able to return to their homeland. They also had separate courts and legal systems. No matter in which country they live in the world, whether it is a Christian or Muslim country, they follow all the rules and regulations of this country. But where is this state today? Has it disappeared from the world? No, not lost; Rather, it has acquired a new shell. The ancient state also had a parliament called 'Senhadrin'. This has been discussed a little in an earlier chapter. The President is the head of this parliamentary system consisting of 71 members. But from where and how these members were selected, was never disclosed. But it was not done in a democratic way. A king used to select members of Parliament based on merit. Raja here refers to their chief religious guru, whose identity was kept very secret. The purpose of this parliamentary system was not to provide security for public life and property; Rather, its purpose was to strengthen imperialism. Jewish Encyclopedia It is known that these members were selected based on the criteria of wealth, prestige and religious knowledge. Their imperialism was not limited to Palestine; Rather, it spread all over the world. Because, if Israel is to be established, it must be done by destroying every country. In 1806, Napoleon became enraged by the activities of the Jews in France. He convened a parliamentary meeting and asked a few questions there, convicting some members of this caste. He also announced that until they can answer these questions correctly, they will be kept in solitary confinement. On February 9, 1807, members of the Sanhedrin held a conference in Paris in support of the brothers. They started their activities in the same old way. From there they declare that they have the right to do anything for the sake of Israel's well-being and development. So, it didn't matter to them what Napoleon wanted to know and didn't want to know. The Jews have kept the parliamentary structure the same to this day to maintain their sense of brotherhood. But it is true, with the passage of time this system has also changed a little. Earlier the Sanhedrin had only 10 seats. It has increased over time. The conference was convened every year at a predetermined time. No matter how busy they were, their members from every country in the world took part in this conference. International economists, politicians, intellectuals, motivational speakers, wealthy businessmen and religious gurus were all invited to these conferences, but most of the members were 'Rabai'. Besides being Rabi's, many were involved in business, politics and many important economic activities. And these members were originally invited to the regular meetings of the Sanhedrin. Not so, only Gupta members were invited to this conference. Several criteria were followed in making invitations. Those who scored higher on this criterion were invited to the conference the following year. It is not known with certainty what these criteria would have included, but some guesses can be made. It may be that who penetrated the administrative depth of other countries, who invented the new formula of economy to ensnare the gentiles, who invented the new doctrine that divides the society, who made the new plan to strengthen the pole of Israel, etc. However, there is no room for debate that they are an orderly and well-organized nation. Such a disciplined nation was not established in a day. They have four hundred economists, politicians and intelligent spies. They hold secret meetings in important cities of the world and retreat secretly after the work. The question may be, how is their foreign policy? The answer is something like this - they consider the Gentiles to be enemies at all times. They believe that to survive in the world, they must survive by confronting the gentile community. As a result, it can be easily guessed that their foreign policy is not friendly at all. They stand in the present, plan for the far-future and collectively pursue this foreign policy. Many of the common members do not know who their king is. In fact, the identity of the king is not revealed to anyone except the members of the Sanhedrin. The identities of some of the members of the Sanhedrin can be guessed through very careful research, but are genuine It is absolutely impossible to guess the identity of the king. The 24th protocol of the book published under the name of Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion about the rules of their invisible state system and the plan to establish world imperialism is mentioned-"Now I will tell you how we will break through the veil of all the powerful kingdoms of the world and restore the throne of King David (Nabi Dawood). This dynasty still exists on earth. Every wise, prudent and educated person is the heir of this dynasty, upon whom the whole world rests the administration has been entrusted. 'This indicates that no matter how much resistance we put up against them, they will regain their throne. They will never deviate from the promise that their imperialism will be established worldwide. Not only in the field of politics that they have spread this influence; Rather, they have strengthened their presence in every important arena like art-literature, education-training, business-trade, armed diplomacy.
                     <br><br>
                     Protocols to establish Jewish imperialism The identity of the author of the Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion has never been discovered. It was first printed in Russian and later translated into other languages. The devastating form of the Duc d'Orleans that the whole world saw during the French Revolution, the book exposes one such form of Jewish imperialism. The book clearly mentions- who are their real enemies and against whom they are plotting. Not that any particular king or aristocracy was the target of their conspiracy; Rather, the entire gentile community of the world is the target of the Jewish conspiracy. The word gentile appears numerous times in this book. Now let's discuss some of its protocols. The first protocol mentions-'No doubt, honesty and simplicity are two noble virtues of human character, but they have no place in the field of politics. Protecting these two human qualities is more difficult than confronting a powerful enemy. Because honesty and simplicity have no place in our governance system. These can only be found in the Gentile regime. Generation after generation we have repeatedly struck down the rule of the Gentiles and imposed our own discipline. The foundation of our governance is money, which we own only. And science? He is also our invention. We will engage workers in various wage hike movements. At the same time, I will increase the price of the product in the market. We will say - due to low agricultural production, the price of goods has increased in the market. As a result, these increased wages will not benefit them at all. We will tactfully spread anarchy among the peasants and make them addicted to alcohol as a means of self-gratification, which will gradually turn them into an ignorant race. Gentiles will never be able to break our web of intrigue. Part of us will mix with the workers in disguise and instigate various rights movements to destabilize the market. Later, a new economy will be established in this unstable market, which we will be the main creators of.
                     <br><br>
If you look closely at the Protocols, you will see that they have divided the entire human race into two parts; We and Gentile. The matter will be clearer if the paragraphs mentioned in the Eighteenth Protocol are noted. For example-'The fundamental difference between us and the Gentiles is that we are God's chosen race and the highest among mankind. And Gentiles are two-legged human animals! They have no foresight, and no ability to invent new things. Antaryami has handed over the governance of this world to us. 'Until it is possible to establish a safe home and a responsible society for the Jewish brothers, let them maintain their character values. It is very important for our national existence. 'How successful they are in implementing the protocols can be realized just by looking around. If you look closely, you will see that there is a teacher giving lectures to the students. He teaches students how to create and execute plans against the Gentiles. Apart from this, these passages also mention how far the Jewish plan has been implemented and how much remains to be done. No information or opinion is sought from the students participating in the discussion here. That is, all their plans are coming from the head of only one Guru. And everyone else is bound to follow this rule. After the manuscript of the Protocols appeared in the market, the Jews began to say—'If indeed we had any secret plan to establish such an imperialism, it would never have been revealed to the Gentiles. 'In fact it is not revealed by them or any member of the Sanhedrin. As mentioned in an earlier chapter, the Zionists very secretly organize occasional meetings in the important cities of the world. Perhaps a particularly interested individual followed the group for a long time and secretly learned the protocols, which he later published in the form of lecture notes. If you study the entire manuscript carefully, you will realize that these protocols were not created today or a hundred years ago. These are proof of their long history, tradition, religion and social system. But in the context of time and the protocols have changed slightly due to strategic conditions. One of the paragraphs of the First Protocol will find—"We have been using the doctrines of freedom, equality, fraternity as tools since ancient times. But the stupid-ass intellectuals of the world are considering these doctrines as a means of securing their rights and are sacrificing their lives for it. They themselves have ensnared our pages and destroyed the sense of brotherhood among themselves. Perhaps even the most intelligent and tactful people have not been able to understand the meaning of these doctrines. They have never understood - there is no such thing as unity, equality or freedom at all. 'Thirteenth regarding who has the right to make changes to these protocols the protocol discusses-'Only those who are many have the power to bring about change in this system have kept these protocols intact for centuries. 'Another thing to note is that no personal honor or ambition of the speaker is revealed here. Their sole purpose is to make Israel's future strong and strong. They have already managed to create a rift in the gentile social order with their confusing doctrines. In spite of all this, there have been, through the ages, men among the gentiles, who have said with a loud voice, that much of what is considered science today, is not true science. What we think of as laws of economic and social order, are not laws at all. These are some fallacious man-made rules that have been used as tools to create a rift between us. As a result, we cannot unite even against known enemies. They have imposed such an educational system on us that we cannot question or even think about Jewish protocols. Due to which I am growing up imbibing their rules like a sheep. The attitude of the Jews towards the Gentiles No matter how intelligent or superior we think we are, to the Jews we are nothing but stupid, asses, and simple-minded creatures about us.
                     <br><br>
                     That their ideas are ludicrous but true can only be understood by a thorough study of the Book of Protocols. Let us now present the Jewish view of the Gentiles with some selected protocols. Let's start with the first protocol-'You have to remember that there are more bad people than good people in the world. Intimidation is the only tactic to get them to budge. They can never be tamed by formal and bookish education. Everyone is greedy for power and everyone wants to see himself as a ruler. And it is rare to sacrifice your own good for the good of others. It will not be wrong to say that Gentiles have a strong nature. They are willing to divide themselves even because of petty emotions, beliefs, traditions and personal pride. A sudden decision calls for a mass movement. Again two-one false propaganda removed Mahanayaka from power. An intelligent animal would never do that. So, they can never come out of anarchy and chaos. In a democratic society, public approval is required before implementing any new plan. But they don't understand it, most people are totally stupid and unintelligent. Once they run behind the right side, another time behind the left side. It is never possible to get constructive advice from them. The path to achieving our desired goal has already become much easier. We have been able to branch out into every important branch of gentile psychology. We have been able to subdue them by showing the lust of the transitory world. I have built a wall of division and difference between them by exploiting the character weakness. 'Now look at a paragraph of the Fifth Protocol-'Jantals value promises more than work, but they don't care if they are fulfilled at all. We can subdue them only by making promises. Even if you don't worry about it after coming to power.'
                     <br><br>
                     The eleventh protocol states-'In fact the gentiles are a flock of sheep. Whatever we promise, they will accept blindly. We will promise freedom, but before that we will spread chaos, anarchy and war among them. How long do they have to wait for this freedom? If we want, we can extend the duration of this war and peace talks. First, I will instill fear in them and then promise to deliver them from that fear. 'This time what has been said about the participation of Gentiles in various intelligence agencies-'Generally adventurous, adventurous and ambitious people join various spy agencies to gain social acclaim. We will find them very easily and use them for various purposes as per the plan. Curious gentiles have spawned countless intelligence agencies with the whole world in front of them. They believe that through this intelligence agency, the secrets of all the criminal activities of the society will be revealed. In some cases, we will bring them success, which will give birth to arrogance and pride in them. In this they will definitely accept our further suggestions without any bias. You can't even imagine how stupid this bragging and arrogance will make them! In such a situation even, a small failure is enough to break their morale. Gentiles, in fact, work for egoism, popularity, and self-assertion. But selfishness is not our concern; Rather, national purpose is the main purpose of our life. 'According to their commentary, the Gentiles took mental stimulation and new doctrines like food. But he refuses to research the future consequences of the new doctrines. They accept what they see. The Zionists have imposed numerous doctrines on us to this day. Whenever one doctrine failed, another was brought to market. At every step the Gentiles became weak and leaderless. If the people of the country are united, the government is bound to surrender. However, the common people do not have a clear idea about the basis of which the people of the country are united. That's what they did.
                     <br><br>
What the leaders are asking to do. This is exactly how the proletariat began in the Bolshevik revolution. Capitalizing on anarchy and chaos, there is always a third group trying to loot society. Despite knowing this, the political parties of the country do not want to unite under the influence of pride. As a result, the looting third party loots its own interests at will. And this third party is the Jewish people. Basically, many of us do not know what real development means. Our ancestors ushered in a new era in human civilization with the invention of the wheel. The turbine is made of wheels. The technique of turning turbines using flowing air and water currents was invented, which led to the discovery of electricity. Today we are generating electricity by making small explosions with petrol-diesel. Now the question is - is the wheel turbine an outdated technology? Using wind and water power, the new energy that our ancestors gave birth to, cannot be accepted in society? Are these technologies unable to meet the needs of today's society? In fact, the things that we have accepted as 'ways of progress' have actually destroyed our country, society and nation. Anarchy creates an evolution in society, which forces vulnerable populations to accept what looks good to the eye as the ideal, but behind this ideal lies the devil. Democracy, Socialism, Communism, Conservatism, Capitalism, Fundamentalism, etc. are all examples of these, which are gaining ground in the world by their hands. Here are some examples of how they are forcing their doctrines into our heads: From a paragraph in the First Protocol—'Political freedom is merely a destructive concept. There are many states where no political force exists other than the party in power. People also do not want any party to be formed there. In such a situation, if you want to bring down the ruling party, you have to insert the issue of political freedom into the brain of the society. It must be understood that everyone has the right to do politics. If the people want, they can put anyone in power as their representative. Gradually, it will become easier to form new political parties in that society, using which we will give birth to multiple parties. Build numerous supporters for each team. This will create a rift in the unity of the Gentiles, which will ultimately result in the fall of the ruling party and the empowerment of new forces.'
                     <br><br>
                     Note in Pathyam protocol-'In order to control public opinion we shall in the beginning introduce various doctrines into the minds of the Gentiles, which will give rise to a thousand labyrinths among them. Once you will get bored and say - it is better not to get involved in political debates. This strategy will help to remove the supporters of other parties from the field of politics. 'Second, we will easily satisfy people's habitual needs. Scarcity breeds humanity in the human heart, whereas luxury makes people dehumanized. When people can easily satisfy their personal needs, they will not come forward to meet the needs of others. Personal pleasure will begin to dominate for them. As a result, they can never be united in moments of state disaster. Because, by then, their thinking power will be completely destroyed. 'Thirteenth Protocol mentions-'You will observe, we only ask for the acceptance of the promise. Whether it will be implemented or not, we have no headache. We say, welfare of people is our purpose. And I say this for this reason, so that common people accept our words as truth and our acceptance in the society increases. 'We will create countless new problems to remove political thoughts from the minds of restless people. This will create many hurdles in their daily livelihood. For example: Wage issues, job security, rising commodity prices etc. In such a situation, no one will want to bother with political debates. 'We will immerse them in entertainment, sports and a life of luxury. they are They will only be busy with themselves and lose interest in thinking about other things. In this way, one time their independent thinking will disappear.' Using liberal, democratic and free-spirited principles, I will begin to sway the gentiles between the various gyres. They will consider liberal policies as part of progress, but this stupid nation does not know the definition of progress.'
                     <br><br>
                     Not just politicians; By the combined efforts of writers, poets, teachers, socialists and rabbis, the Jews have put the entire human race in many confusing situations, beginning thousands of years ago. Not only today, they have done so in the past and will continue to do so in the future. Note the Ninth Protocol-'By establishing monarchy, socialism, democracy, communism (communism), etc., we will divide each nation into smaller parts. I will also engage them in our service. Through this we will be able to overthrow every existing regime on earth. I will not allow any nation of the earth to remain in punishment until they accept our precepts. Thereafter, the Tenth Protocol states-"Whenever we introduced liberal and democratic principles into the countries of the world, it changed the contours of political parties overnight. “The Ninth Protocol mentions how the education system of the Gentiles will be - 'A false and fabricated educational system has already been imposed on the Gentile youth to destroy their intelligence, moral sense and independent thinking; Although we ourselves will not accept this system of education. 'The Tenth Protocol mentions how the education system can be used to bridge the gap in family ties. 'We will make our established educational system the criteria for checking their qualifications. Before entering the working life, I will leave this educational system with the establishment of the method of evaluation of competence. At some point this education system will instill arrogance and pride in them, which will lead to severing of relations between family members. Until the desired time is at hand, I will immerse them in various amusements. I will continue to make constant efforts to make the doctrines mentioned earlier important to them.
                     <br><br>
                     Darwinism, Marxism, Nazism etc. were presented to them as means of progress. Based on these theories, we have destroyed their sense of morality and there will be no exception in the days to come.  'Note that nowhere in the Protocols does it say that they intend to destroy the Gentiles forever; Rather, they want the gentiles to accept their lordship and remain slaves forever. They have already come a long way in implementing this goal. Today the whole world is running under an invisible dictatorship. 'We know the foundations of Gentile unity are very weak. Even if only for a short time we can weaken them again. We have done these many times in the last two thousand years. 'Partial Implementation of the Protocol System of the Jewish State If you read the 'Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion' out of mere curiosity, then to some people this book will seem like a mere literary work. The way the author talks about his destructive plans with great confidence is really surprising. He says-'We have gone a long way according to the plan. Now for us It is not possible to go back. 'The Ninth Protocol states-'Now there are no more obstacles in front of us. We have come a long way in planning the New World Order. Courts, administration, jurisprudence are all in our possession today. Once we were subjects, today we have bought them as subjects. Undoubtedly, we are stricter rulers than them. 'Now look at the eighth protocol-'In this plan we will give birth to many economists around the world. Because there is no greater tool in the world than Arthasastra. We will give birth to countless personalities like bankers, industrialists and tycoons all around, who will develop themselves into attractive personalities. Ignorant gentiles will think they are their own philosophy, but each of them will be the instrument of our future plan.'
                     <br><br>
                     What we are being taught in the present education system is the syllabus imposed by them. At the time of the Bolshevik Revolution, the world went through an era when 7/8 out of every ten books written on economics were written by Jews. In fact there is no problem in reading the books written by them. But when they deliberately impose an education system full of mistakes on us to paralyze gentile society, it is necessary to speak out against it. They were the first to oppose the religious education system and banned the teaching of the Bible from educational institutions. The Ninth Protocol states-"We have always maintained a good relationship with the Christian clergy. Once upon a time we flattered them so much that we could penetrate deep into them and destroy all sense of morality. No more flattery needed. Because, among them, the importance of religion has already decreased. As a result, the trust of the common people in the Pope and the clergy has gradually started to disappear. Then the first protocol states-'Anarchy and instability will make us more vulnerable day by day. Like an invisible shadow hiding our identity, we will fuel instability in every state. As a result, the Gentiles will not be able to keep up with us even if they try a thousand times. 'The second protocol states-"In every war, we will ensure that both sides suffer and financial disaster falls on both sides. I will create the context in such a way that after the war all the powers come to our hands. 'How much they are used to humiliating and humiliating others is revealed in the following paragraphs-'Our publishing houses will regularly publish articles on the failure of gentile governments. After reading this news, the general public will get upset with the government. In fact, while running a state, everyone makes small mistakes. We will publicize the government's mistakes in such a way that their good deeds go unnoticed.'
                     <br><br>
                     Now from the fifth protocol-'Already we have succeeded in greatly curtailing the powers of the gentiles to make state laws. The verdict of the court will be what we say. 'The Fourteenth Protocol states-'We have spread the seeds of lies, fabrications and obscene literature in every country. I explained to common people, these are part of modernity. Changed the past history and replaced it with a new story and made the common people believe it. 'The twelfth protocol states-'We have already concentrated on gathering news from different parts of the world with the help of media. Through a chain-chain, we have been able to dominate almost every country's media in an invisible way. 'The Seventh Protocol also says exactly the same thing-'With the help of propaganda we will tie the hands and feet of the gentile governments. They can't do anything against us even if they want to. Because, at any moment, we can unleash a tide of agitation against them, which will uproot them from power. 'Now look at the twelfth protocol-'Why not call them fools and asses when they sit quietly in spite of all our machinations and ask us for advice instead of power? 'The Ninth Protocol deals with several strategies for implementing plans and achieving victory It is said-'At first it was quite difficult to intervene directly on the Gentiles. Their strong walls were impenetrable to us. But after introducing the issue of democracy into their heads, everything changed in an instant. Freedom of expression, freedom of media, freedom of education and culture, Equal suffrage, equal law are all basic principles of democratic society. If these things take place in the society, everything becomes easier for us.'
                     <br><br>
America has special protections for Jewish children. A separate educational system was devised to keep them outside the control of the gentiles up to a certain age. The addresses of the schools where the religious education of the Jews is imparted are kept so secret that even the great rou-katlara of the city do not know it. They are not allowed to go to gentile doctors even when they need serious treatment; They have separate treatment systems. The Jews have already spread many seeds of obscenity to destroy the moral sense of the Gentile youth. For example, who are the inventors of jazz music? Who introduced nudity to the theater and film industry? Who turned pornography into a commercial industry? Who is encouraging our youth to join the military? Who are making their pockets heavy with profit by sending them to war with the lure of their exciting life? Who changed the clothing expectations of our youth and established nudity as part of civilized culture? In this context it is said in the protocol of the Jews-'We have already imposed an unrealistic and unreasonable educational system on the gentile youth to destroy their intellectual, moral and independent thinking. 'Watching movies now and then is considered the ideal pastime for any youth in a middle-class family today. Similarly, promiscuity is also recognized as an ideal form of entertainment among the youth of wealthy families. How this dirty culture found its way into our society will be discussed in detail in the chapters on theatre, film and music. But in this part I would like to say very little - using the principles of liberalism and free thinking, Jews have imported a lot of vulgar culture into our society. A huge amount of money has been invested behind it. Expensive entertainment, drug use, gambling, jazz music, ostentatious fashion, jewelry, etc., are all things that make the Gentiles famous today. Many popular sports are about to be destroyed due to the violence of their bettors. Indeed, there is no branch of human life into which the Jews have not injected poison. Gentiles are not usually born with a conspiratorial mindset. Ordinary people plan how to achieve a goal, but Jews plan How to achieve four-five objectives together! We can never enter their den of conspiracy by holding only a rope. I will lose even the way back to it. This requires keen observation of surrounding issues and keen knowledge of history. But for this first we need to remove the thing called 'mental laziness' from our brain. Jewish power and authority in the political arena the things they are using as tools to make the many planned world programs (New World Order) successful are: A. Securing each country's economic future by engaging in devastating wars. Establishing control over industrialization by keeping the capital market under their control. Imposing on the Gentiles an education system that would destroy their thinking and intelligence. Attracting common people to various pleasant and entertaining things (eg: jazz music, drugs), which will lead to their moral degradation. Spreading the seeds of division and spawning numerous political revolutions in the society. How the representatives of the state (president, prime minister) will be elected, how the monarchy will be broken and democracy will rise, how the constitution of different states will be written and how political activities will be conducted, none of the protocols have been ignored. Their protocols believe in constant change. For example, general elections every few days, empowerment of new representatives, regular changes in laws and constitution etc. They subtly incite the public to bring a new representative to power in the next term. Note the first protocol-'A general idea we have been able to establish in independent countries. That is - the people are the source of all power. A public representative (government) needs to be elected from among them to govern the country properly. But we can change these representatives from time to time, just as we change gloves when they get old. We are the ones who give birth to these people's representatives and we are the ones who remove them from power.'
                     <br><br>
It is possible to get a lot of work done by a popular representative. Because, common people have full faith in him. The system of governance followed in most countries of the world today is democracy. At the same time, another system is trying to stand up and that is - socialism. Before that, the system that existed around the world was monarchy. Democracy says that the government elected by the people will take over the governance of the whole country. So it is said that people are the source of all power. However, every country has to go through many ups and downs on the way to establishing this democracy, including riots, strikes, fires, military revolutions and many more. The Fourth Protocol discussed how a democratic country would be-A country takes the form of a democratic state after passing many steps. In the first phase, riots spread like barbarian times throughout the country. And people support the right or the left like fools and destroy state resources. In the second step, the illegitimate dictator is born. Although a dictator may not be in power for long, his influence remains forever. Some popular leaders and activists will be born at this time. Later, someone from among them will be brought to power, who will work only for us. We can remove him if necessary. None of the Gentiles will understand this secret game. They will only be busy with electing public representatives. 'The issue of 'regular change' in the system of government is not new to Europe-America. There is no senator who is not familiar with it. Only when the representatives became involved in the Jewish controversy did change occur. Economic blockades began to fall on them quickly. All the big business establishments started turning away, which pushed the country into conflict situation. He does not understand why the people of the country are agitating against him. He worked for common people out of patriotism. But the media has already gone for another party. They can create any public opinion against the government as they wish. As a result, anarchy and chaos never ceases. The Fourteenth Protocol states-'The gentiles will eventually tire of so many changes in administration, but we will re-invigorate them in a destructive movement against the government. At the end of the day, they will agree to accept any of our conditions to restore the peace of the state system.'
How successful they are in establishing global political power can be understood from a paragraph of the Ninth Protocol-"Today, if any head of state moves against us, it is only for the sake of power. But their power is in our hands. Whatever they will agitate about, is also guided by our gesture. Who will they resist against us? All the parliament members around him are greedy. Buying them is a no-brainer for us. 'Then it is further said-'In fact, we have removed from power many heads of state in the world. But there are still many more to be evacuated. 'Regarding where the economic support behind these movements will come from, the ninth protocol says-'Due to the mutual enmity of the political parties, the entire power of the state came into our hands. As a result, we resolve their disputes. We will continue to pour ghee into this enmity. We will provide the money needed for this. 'There have been many investigations into the source of so much money during the election campaign, but its source has never been traced. As a result, most of the administrations of Europe-America today have taken the form of Jewish administrations. The second protocol states-"The person whom we elect as a ruler from among the people, never let him be a slave to the common people. A group of our representatives will serve as his advisors in the ministry, who have grown up in our education system since childhood. These representatives know very well how to run the country and how to protect our interests. 'The Tenth Protocol states-How will the end of the monarchy lead to a coup d'état of democracy and the birth of an electoral regime from autocracy.'

                     <br><br>
After the Soviet forces succeeded in the Bolshevik Revolution in 1918, Russian Jewish students and soldiers took to the streets and began singing-"We have given you a God. Now we will give you a king." An article of the 10th Protocol mentions the election of a democratic government-"When the era of democracy begins, the people will go to the process of electing a president from among themselves. Whoever comes to power, we will spend equally on the ruling and opposition parties. Just as landmines are planted under the ground, the gentiles will lay similar mines in society by democratically electing statesmen. 'Whoever comes to power, there are bound to be some political parties against him. They will be busy all the time with demonstrations, marches and agitations. If the ruling party cannot suppress them with a firm hand, then the government will surely fall. Again, if it is to be strictly controlled, the law-and-order forces will have to be brutal. So as the days go by, the explosive mine will be more powerful. "We will organize the election process in our own way. As candidates, I will give priority to those whose past history is full of dark chapters; Much like the Panama scandal. One might expose their past history – a fear they will always be haunted by after coming to power. Due to which they will become our loyal workers even if they don't want to. Will it be a difficult task for us to take advantage of various administrative benefits by using them? 'The reason for the mention of the word 'Panama' here is that the digging of the Panama Canal gave birth to a lot of corruption in the political circles of France. All those who have been elected as President of the United States till date have a history of stigma. It is not that no one knows the stigma of those who sit on the throne of power. Before the election, the scandalous history of the desired candidate is covered up with the help of the media. But yes, Jews can vilify a party they don't want to see in power. As a result, the elected representatives were forever trapped by the secret organization of the Jews. If the public representatives are ever disobedient, it is not difficult to expose their past and spread fire in the public mind.
                     <br><br>
These days the issue of 'fear' in the political neighborhood seems to have caught everyone. Not just America; There is not a nation in Germany, Armenia, Russia, or Hindustan that would dare to speak the slightest word against the Jews or Israel. Maybe they have the power to vote against Israel on any issue proposed by the League of Nations, but no one dares to criticize their terrorist activities. He has the specter of anti-Semitism. The poor among the Jews are richer than our rich. Despite being a minority, they are more powerful today. It is important for them to keep alive this fear if they are to maintain their hegemony in world governance. But the way they have given birth to this fear and kept it alive till date, should be applauded. Because it is also a kind of art. There is a balance in all their plans. And whenever this balance is threatened, their naked form comes out.In truth, Jews are not superhuman beings. They are flesh and blood like us. They may be intelligent and smart, but nothing has happened to them to Cornish. We all have an equal right to live on earth. No matter how clever the Jews, there is no veil that can cover their ugly history. And here lies their weakness. If the world knew how to find this weakness of the Jews, it would be possible to break free from the veil of fear with which they block us. Jewish plan to attack land resources The specter of Jewish landlords in the housing industry changed the face of many cities around the world overnight in the early 20th century. Every time land is sold, it has become a practice to set a higher price than the previous price. In 1918-19 the Commonwealth Committee enacted some laws to resolve the land crisis. Although it should have been done long ago. The Chairman of the Committee on personal inquiry traced the identity of certain families whose only occupation was land business. They would repeatedly buy and sell the same land between different family members, so as to increase the demand for it in the market. Finally, when the sale price of the land reached the desired level, the Jews would sell it to the Gentiles. Once upon a time there were many places in Europe-America, whose names and smells have not even been heard by common people. They used to buy those lands from the real owners very systematically.
                     <br><br>
Hearing the price at which they offered to buy the land, the land owners thought that no one would come here and buy such land. In this situation, many people sold their lands thinking that they are getting so much value or less. Then they used to do some work to develop those lands. For example: construction of schools, hospitals, roads etc. After that, promotion and advertisement work started in big cities. Some of their members used to show interest in purchasing these lands under disguise to attract everyone's attention. Their publishing houses published regular columns about this, so that the whole city could be kept active in the discussion of these lands. He would carry on this discussion like a skilled actor in every place, be it tea shop, liquor shop or bazaar discussion stage. They themselves did not call the gentiles into these discussions, but the way they discussed it among themselves in a loud voice, greatly increased the curiosity of the common people. Even if they didn't want to, this rumor would enter their subconscious mind. People thought that such good land was still available outside the city. So why not buy something for themselves before all the land ends? At one time many local and foreign investors were confused by their tricks and showed interest in these lands and bought them; But it is very expensive, as is the case with lands in Washington, New York and Florida. From the middle the Jews took huge profits, a commission of which went to their banking institutions. Because, they used to help with money at different times. It is no secret that middle-class families struggle to find a decent home within their means. The sad thing is that this satanic culture of land trade has penetrated even among the Gentiles today. If the Committee Chair had not conducted this investigation on a personal initiative, this information would never have been made public. Because the statistics bureaus of different countries are being controlled by the Jews alone. They have built many other small groups within the intelligence force, which are working hand in hand with the famous intelligence agency. As a result, whatever information the Bureau of Statistics publishes, it is not possible without the consent of the Intelligence. Apart from selling the land at a high price, the Jews had other motives for buying these lands. such as Allowing gentile peasants to use their own land. The matter is much like Barga farming. As a result, a large portion of the produce would have gone to their warehouses. Besides, if most of the lands were under their control, the Gentiles would never be able to mount a resistance. As a result, generation after generation They will work in the fields as farmers. Apart from that, the Jews have a different level of infatuation with the lands where gold, silver, copper, nickel etc. are stored. For example: lands in Alaska, California. When the Jews planned to occupy a country, they first tried to occupy the productive lands of that country. Through this, it is possible to establish control over the food products produced and the raw materials used in the industry. As a result, the industrial market gradually came under their control. The capital market also started walking in the same way. Then their arbitrariness began the conflict between the capital market and the labor market, which never ends. Before World War I, America imported a lot of woolen goods from Germany. Shortly before the start of the war, they withdrew all orders. German businessmen suffered huge losses. Overnight prices of woolen goods there started to fall. German Jews who could afford them bought them at very low prices. After the war, they re-exported the product to the American market at a higher price. If a disaster befalls the American market, Jewish publishing houses come forward to cover their crimes. Blaming Italian, Polish, British or German nationals as the cause of the disaster, but never naming themselves. Lately they have been using the Gentiles as land agents. The same is true in the banking world. As a result, it is not possible for Gentiles to identify the real conspirators. An earlier protocol states that Jews create artificial demand to increase the price of goods in the market. First of all, barga cultivation gives them a huge ownership of the produce. Secondly, surplus produce is bought strategically from farmers. Then the Jews became the middlemen of all goods. The price they determine becomes the market selling price; Which the consumer is forced to pay. Essentially, the consumer does not buy products; Rather, it only frees them from their hostages. Another example of speculation is the Jewish takeover of the American cotton market. Bank loans were their ideal tool for this work. At first, the use of cotton land was reduced as much as possible. When the farmers came to the bank for loans, they were allotted land for cultivation. Banks would not give them loans if they cultivated more than the prescribed acre of land. As a result, despite the demand, the production of cotton would have decreased. 
                     <br><br>
Neither the industrialists could get the required amount of cotton, nor the farmers could repay the bank loans. Finally, the banks came and took over the lands and made the farmers beggars. As a result, both the land and the market were theirs. A rumor about satanic invasion of the cotton industry was in the American air at the end of the nineteenth century. But Gentiles realized its true form only when there was nothing else to do. Their protocols did not mention much about land. which is discussed It happened only in the sixth protocol. such as "We will give birth to a monopoly by taking possession of all the resources of the market. No matter how wealthy the gentile states are, at some point they will have to rely on our resources. This dependence will trap them in debt, which will weigh on them as a national liability. By exploiting their weakness, we will create an international dictatorship. Then only we can save this world humanity from great disaster. We will show favor only to those who obey all our commandments. Arrogance has disappeared from the character of gentile politicians. But still since they own huge land resources and are able to earn their livelihood independently, they may become a threat to us one day. So, they have to occupy all the land at any cost. The most effective way to do this is to trap farmers in mortgage loans. We will encourage them to take loans. Gradually the loan interest will weigh on the farmers. Even after becoming the owners of the land, they will be subordinate to us. This obedience will destroy all their pride and arrogance. I would encourage Gentiles to take the industrial economy forward, as if they were part of us. But I will make sure that this encouragement does not benefit them. If we start lending money to gentiles without any plan, their wealth will increase greatly. If this continues, they will eventually come out of debt bondage and free all land. We will never let that happen. Decapitalize Gentiles through speculative schemes. Someday they will be in crisis of existence like the proletariat and will come to our feet and knock their heads for survival.
                     <br><br>
We will involve the workers in the movement for higher wages and at the same time increase the prices of commodities in the market. We will say that the commodity prices have increased this year due to less agricultural production. I will tactfully spread anarchy among them and make them addicted to alcohol as a means of self-gratification. In this way they will gradually become an ignorant nation. People will never understand our subtle plans. We will hide the mask of public service and say - public welfare is our real purpose. But by this purpose we shall only benefit ourselves, and not them. ‘Here are some excerpts from two more protocols, which correspond to: ‘Until the gentiles find refuge in our wealth and power, we will keep them locked in hunger, poverty, famine, discord, mutual enmity, etc.' (Tenth Protocol)"One day they will be forced to hand over all international power to us, and then we will establish ourselves as world masters. 'We will impose on them an educational system which will paralyze their moral consciousness. It will also destroy their ability to make the necessary decisions.' (Fifth Protocol) Those who created the Protocols were international economists, philosophers and wealthy Jews. They know very well what they are going to do and how to do it. They know - as long as the sun rises in the sky and the monsoons and water are in place, the peasantry is an invincible force. Because lack of food is the real lack of the world. He who has the power to produce food can spend his whole life in great comfort without looking elsewhere. So, something should be done, by which these peaceful people can be disturbed. How successful they are in their plans; it is possible to realize just by looking around. As mentioned earlier, the Jews were not at all good at agriculture, but they were masters at making different kinds of products. They were the first to bring into the market flower-tubs, water-pots, table-chairs, etc., with color-work, which fetched high prices. There was a time when people were not interested in buying these products. They believed that wasting money leads to poverty. As a result, the Jews waited for many years with these products.
                     <br><br>
The number of buyers in the market increased by one or two. They make products with new designs known as 'style' and 'fashion'. Instills in people's heads - style and fashion are part of nobility. Once upon a time, the gentile farmers saw that this trade in fine goods was very profitable indeed. It takes a long time to produce crops. Hard work too. Apart from that, once the crop is destroyed, all efforts are in vain. As a result, they also turned towards the production of such products. And this is how we became unproductive as a nation. Gradually many of us became skilled in the fine arts and began to enjoy the grace of society. But we didn't realize that what we were doing was a waste of time and effort. Ghashta protocol is mentioned in this context-'To destroy the industries of the Gentiles, to make them interested in fine goods, which would completely change their conception of wants and tastes. We will encourage them to buy these shiny products. ‘Many parents, civil society and unbiased media have tried to protect young society from degradation. Many wise people have advised them - 'Give up luxury and use wealth for productive purposes.' Many economists have said - 'Don't run after unnecessary industries, run after all the industries that will strengthen the country's economy.' Many publishing houses have suggested - 'Go to the field and produce crops instead of making good products, so that you don't have to be hungry.' The purpose of these warnings is that our youth should not waste time and effort in wrong ways. We are ordinary people - or less. We have increased the demand for unnecessary luxury products. When consumers get tired of buying the same products, they look for different products. Have you ever thought, because of the use of these nice products, the Jews have been harmed at all? You will notice that they are walking in front of you wearing very expensive shiny clothes. These clothes are really expensive and the fabrics are also of high quality. You will see Jewish women walking around wearing huge diamond jewelry, with no artificiality in it. Basically, they will never be victims of their own dishonest discovery. Because, they are not afraid of losing. They came only to destroy us. So the loss will be only us, not them.
                     <br><br>
                     Today our mentality has reached such a state that we have to modernize ourselves with the change of times, change in taste and adapt ourselves to different styles and fashions. Once upon a time we were afraid to waste even a little money for fear of poverty. And now let's keep a part of the earnings aside, so that we can buy some new nice products next year. There is a group of people who decide long in advance what new products will be brought to the market next year and beyond. The Jews have built a mountain of profit by destroying our commercial, economic and visionary spirit. Basically, we caught them ourselves. Now, look at the first protocol-'We will never force the gentiles to buy the fine goods, but they are too stupid to fall into this net themselves. ‘Due to our mental retardation, the profession of 'farmer' has become an object of hatred for many people today. The situation has taken such a form that farmers have started hating themselves today. They do not want their children to enter this profession. Their only wish is that the children should earn a living through something else. But agriculture is one of the oldest professions in the world, which has provided employment to the largest number of people till date. I can understand the negative impact on the society due to looking at such a profession with hatred and treating the farmers like a freak. Food scarcity and unemployment, two of the world's most glaring problems, no longer need to be documented. But what could have been a suitable solution to these two problems, we shun with disdain. People today are walking on the path of quick wealth; Be it through alcohol-cigarettes or luxury goods. In fact, until the Great Famine, human society will not realize how misguided it is in knowledge and mentality.
